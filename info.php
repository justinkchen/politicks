		<h1> About the App </h1>
		<p> This app empowers groups political activists to pool their resources to influence issues they care about. It does so by allowing users to give money to an issue they care about. This money becomes a 'bounty' on that issue that can be claimed by a local politician who satisfactorily resolves this issue with a new public policy. The issue donation becomes powerful when an issue becomes viral within the site and many users donate to it. </p>

		<h1> What do I Do? </h1>
		<p>As a user, search through the issues you care about. If you see one you like, donate to it! You won't need to give any money until the politician actually resolves the issue properly. 
		  You can also create a new issue, which will require you to submit your credit card information and detailed info on the issue itself. You will be contacted if/when a local politician attempts to solve the issue with a policy.
		  </p>
